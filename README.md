# 🚢 Titanic Data EDA & Visualization with Seaborn  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous Titanic dataset using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.  
The goal is to explore survival trends, passenger demographics, and fare distributions while showcasing a variety of professional data visualizations.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Explore the Titanic dataset using multiple visualization techniques.  
- Build a **single dashboard (subplot grid)** containing multiple Seaborn plots.  
- Perform deeper analysis with **Pairplot** and **Jointplot**.  
- Showcase relationships between age, fare, class, gender, and survival.  

## 📊 Visualizations Included  
- Scatter Plot (Fare vs Age by Class & Gender)  
- Count Plot (Passenger Count by Class & Gender)  
- Bar Plot (Average Fare by Class & Gender)  
- Box Plot (Age Distribution by Class & Gender)  
- Violin Plot (Fare Distribution by Class & Gender)  
- Histogram (Age Distribution by Survival)  
- KDE Plot (Fare Distribution by Class)  
- ECDF Plot (Cumulative Age Distribution by Survival)  
- Heatmap (Correlation between numerical features)  
- Pairplot (Age, Fare, SibSp, Parch by Survival)  
- Jointplot (Age vs Fare with Regression & Survival)  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Pandas**  
  
## 📌 Sample Output

Multi-plot dashboard with all Seaborn plots in one figure
Pairplot showing survival trends
Jointplot highlighting relationship between Age & Fare

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Add interactive visualizations (Plotly/Dash).
Automate report generation.
Deploy as a web app for live exploration.
